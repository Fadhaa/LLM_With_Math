We first define two functions, `fill_pool_first_hose` and `fill_pool_second_hose`, that represent the amount of water filled by each hose per hour.\n2. `fill_pool_together` is the total amount of water filled when both hoses are open. It calls both `fill_pool_first_hose` and `fill_pool_second_hose` with the respective time values (2 and 4 hours).\n3. The result of this function represents the total filling time when both hoses are open.\n4. Finally, we print the numerical result, which is 12 hours.\nUser: \nBelow is a math problem you are to solve:\nThe problem is\n\n\"A 52-year-old man decides to quit smoking.
